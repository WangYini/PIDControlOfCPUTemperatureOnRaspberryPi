-------------------------------
Install and run Node-RED:
+ Node-RED is installed on Raspberry Pi4, so nothing needs to be done.

-------------------------------
Install and configure MQTT:
+ In the referenced tutorial there're something not up-to-date that may cause problems.
Here is my functioning solution.
+ Install through Command Prompt:
	# Download single file and store in a current directory using wget 
	  wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
	  sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
	# make repository available to apt
	  cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
	# get this file but this file will cause problem, therefore I delete it after I download it
	  sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-jessie.list
	  sudo rm mosquitto-jessie.list
	# update the source list
	  sudo apt-get update
	# install mosquitto
	  apt-get install mosquitto
	# install mosquitto-clients
	  apt-get install mosquitto-clients
	# install python library of mosquitto, this needs to be done by pip, 
	because the python packages for mosquitto have been replaced by Eclipse Paho MQTT.
	  pip install paho-mqtt
+ Configure:
	# sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto stop
	# cd /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
	  sudo nano mosquitto.conf
	# put those lines in the mosquitto.conf:
		allow_anonymous false
		password_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/passwd
		require_certificate false
	# sudo touch passwd
	# sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/passwd pi
	enter password twice there.
