The curcuit in tutorial 
https://www.instructables.com/id/PID-Control-for-CPU-Temperature-of-Raspberry-Pi/
is not 100% correct. It has the possibility to ruin the RaspberryPi's pins.
Here is the curcuit I used.

-------------------------
GPIO pins:
+ Connect PN2222 transistor's Base to a 1K Ohm resistor, then to RaspberryPi's pin GPIO18 (PWM)
+ Connect transistor's Collector to the negative side of the fan.
+ Connect transistor's Emitter to a Ground pin.
+ Connect fan's positive side to a 5V pin.
