# Install and run Node-RED:  
1. Node-RED is installed on Raspberry Pi4, so nothing needs to be done.  

# Install and configure MQTT:  
1. In the referenced tutorial there're something not up-to-date that may cause problems.  
Here is my functioning solution.  
2. Install through Command Prompt:  
	1. Download single file and store in a current directory using wget  
	  wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key  
	  sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key  
	2. make repository available to apt  
	  cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  
	3. get this file but this file will cause problem, therefore I delete it after I download it  
	  sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-jessie.list  
	  sudo rm mosquitto-jessie.list  
	4. update the source list  
	  sudo apt-get update  
	5. install mosquitto  
	  apt-get install mosquitto  
	6. install mosquitto-clients  
	  apt-get install mosquitto-clients  
	7. install python library of mosquitto, this needs to be done by pip, because the python packages for mosquitto have been replaced by Eclipse Paho MQTT.  
	  pip install paho-mqtt  
3. Configure:  
	1. sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto stop  
	2. cd /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/  
	  sudo nano mosquitto.conf  
	3. put those lines in the mosquitto.conf:  
		allow_anonymous false  
		password_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/passwd  
		require_certificate false  
	4. sudo touch passwd  
	5. sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/passwd pi  
	enter password twice there.
