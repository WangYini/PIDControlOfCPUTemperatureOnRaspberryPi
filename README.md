# PIDControlOfCPUTemperatureOnRaspberryPi  
Build my first raspberry pi project of PID control over CPU temperature from scratch.  
This tutorial is based on this online instruction https://www.instructables.com/id/PID-Control-for-CPU-Temperature-of-Raspberry-Pi/.  
Thanks to Stephen LEE sharing this instruction I was able to build my raspberry pi project from scratch. I also noticed that there are several places in the instruction that may not work. Some of them are due to not up-to-date issues. Therefore I've pointed them out in my tutorial.  
I also summarzied several points that I find useful regarding Raspberry Pi, PID control tuning, linux commands and curcuit knowledge. It will be very useful for you if you are a beginner of raspberry pi.
