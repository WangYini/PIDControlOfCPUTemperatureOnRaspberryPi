## 1st Trial: Set target temperature = 50 °C:[yellow block]  
* Since raspberry pi has already been in a higher temperature of about 58 °C, I lowered
down the temperature as far as I can firstly. It lowered to about 44 °C and didn't go lower any more.  
* After several trials I found out that due to the curcuit itself and fan's power, the temperature
will stay between 42 to 59 °C.  
* Therefore, I set the target temperature to 50 °C.  

## 2nd Trial: Set only Kp = 1, Kd = 0, Ki = 0: [red block]  
* The temperature went up to about 55 °C and stayed there steadily.

## 3rd Trial: Set Kp = 100, Kd = first -1 then -20, Ki = 0: [blue block]  
* I first thought the reason that the temperature went up to 55 °C was a problem of overshoot, so I changed the Kd value to -1 then to -20 to see how the overshoot changes.  
* It still gives me quite large (about 5°C) error. So turning Kd is not helping.  
  
## 4th Trial: Set Kp = 1, Kd = -30, Ki = -10: [green block]  
* I came to the idea that the 5 °C is an steady-state error, therefore I added a Ki value to eliminate the error.  
* It turns out that the error is eliminated.  
* The temperature is steady between 48°C to 53°C. =>Successful!
