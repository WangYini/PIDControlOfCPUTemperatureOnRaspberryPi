-------------------------------
Node MQTT In/MQTT Out from module MQTT:
+ Mosquitto has a MQTT broker, which is a server.
+ Mosquitto has clients, they can be publisher and subscriber.
+ node MQTT In is like a subscriber, it gets message from publisher, which is MQTT Out.
+ In these nodes' configuration properties, you can 
	set the Server to localhost:1883
	set the Topic, so the subscriber of the same topic gets the message from the publisher of the same topic,
	set the QoS, Quality of Service:
		At most once(0)
		At least once(1)
		Exactly once(2)
+ If you want to test MQTT in linux command prompt, you write those three lines in three prompt windows:
	mosquitto
	mosquitto_sub -v -t "topic/test"
	mosquitto_pub -t "topic/test" -m "helloWorld"
your subscriber will recieve message helloWorld.

-------------------------------
Node Chart/Gauge from module Dashboard (node-red-dashboard):
+ Use manage palette -> install to install missing nodes from other modules
+ Those nodes are used for showing the data.

-------------------------------
Node PID Control from module (node-red-node-pidcontrol):
+ PID control target: Set Point
+ PID control has 3 influencial parameters:
	# Proportional part: decrease the Rise Time
	# Differential part: reduce the Overshoot and Settling Time
	# Integral part: eliminate the Steady-State Error
+ four major characteristics:
	see pic pid parameters influence the major characters.jpeg
	see pic four major characters.jpg

------------------------------
Check CPU's Temperature:
+ Node Inject: trigger check for every 5 seconds
+ Node Exec: execute command line vcgencmd measure_temp, get the temperature of cpu

------------------------------
Chart & Gauge: CPU temperature:
+ Format temperature data into chart/gauge.

-----------------------------
PID Control For CPU Temperature of Raspberry PI:
+ Node PID Control: based on current temperature calculate the pid output and give those data to an MQTT publisher.
+ Format pid output data into chart/gauge.

-----------------------------
PID-PLANT:
+ Calculate how many output need to be given to the fan through output pin GPIO18.
+ has something to do with PWM duty cycle.
