# Nodes Expanation  

## Node MQTT In/MQTT Out from module MQTT:  
* Mosquitto has a MQTT broker, which is a server.  
* Mosquitto has clients, they can be publisher and subscriber.  
* node MQTT In is like a subscriber, it gets message from publisher, which is MQTT Out.  
* In these nodes' configuration properties, you can   
	* set the Server to localhost:1883  
	* set the Topic, so the subscriber of the same topic gets the message from the publisher of the same topic,  
	* set the QoS, Quality of Service:  
		* At most once(0)  
		* At least once(1)  
		* Exactly once(2)  
* If you want to test MQTT in linux command prompt, you write those three lines in three prompt windows:  
	* mosquitto  
	* mosquitto_sub -v -t "topic/test"  
	* mosquitto_pub -t "topic/test" -m "helloWorld"  
* your subscriber will recieve message helloWorld.  

## Node Chart/Gauge from module Dashboard (node-red-dashboard):  
* Use manage palette -> install to install missing nodes from other modules  
* Those nodes are used for showing the data.  

## Node PID Control from module (node-red-node-pidcontrol):  
* PID control target: Set Point  
* PID control has 3 influencial parameters:  
	* Proportional part: decrease the Rise Time  
	* Differential part: reduce the Overshoot and Settling Time  
	* Integral part: eliminate the Steady-State Error  
* four major characteristics:

# Modules Expanation  

## Check CPU's Temperature:  
* Node Inject: trigger check for every 5 seconds  
* Node Exec: execute command line vcgencmd measure_temp, get the temperature of cpu  

## Chart & Gauge: CPU temperature:  
* Format temperature data into chart/gauge.  

## PID Control For CPU Temperature of Raspberry PI:  
* Node PID Control: based on current temperature calculate the pid output and give those data to an MQTT publisher.  
* Format pid output data into chart/gauge.  

## PID-PLANT:
* Calculate how many output need to be given to the fan through output pin GPIO18.  
* has something to do with PWM duty cycle.
